# The Pitching/Submitting Process

The projects pitching+story creation process involves several steps, with lots of feedback! They mostly take place on the [Issues section](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues) of the repository. They're called issues but we're using them to track pitches, feedback, and story progress.

Each issue will have a series of **labels** attached to it, like `Type: Pitch` or `Requested: Assistance`. While you can't assign these - people in charge of this repository can - you can say things like [Pitch] or [Request assistance] to suggest that people tag the repositories.

## Step 1: The Pitch

First, you'll need to pitch your story by opening a new issue.

[Here is an example pitch](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/1), which includes a data source, a "my piece will look like this" image, and a request to find some more data. Notice the [Pitch] [Data request] in the submission title.

Include images by pasting them into the text area, or dragging them from your desktop.

## Step 2: Feedback

You'll need to go through several rounds of feedback: first, peer feedback and then editorial feedback. After each round of feedback you'll need to respond. It's best if you respond particularly to what the person was saying, but a "thanks!" is sometimes good enough.

You can see an [an example of feedback](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/1#issuecomment-234377726) and [an example of a pitcher response](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/1#issuecomment-234379100) on the sample issue. I know it's all done by one person, but *I am very sorry I don't have multiple github accounts*.

## Step 3: Editorial feedback and approval

After your editorial feedback, you may need to revise your pitch a little more. Eventually you'll (hopefully) be approved, and you can move on to the story process.

[This is a pitch being approved](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/1#issuecomment-234380193). Once the pitch is approved and the story issue is created, an admin will close down the pitch issue.

## Step 4: Creating the story issue

Once your story is approved, you can open up a new issue. [Here is an example](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/2), you'll note I titled it with [Story] to suggest a story tag.

The story issue is a lot like your pitch issue, except you incorporate everything that changed over the course of the discussion. Maybe you found new data sets or new points of view - explain that here, pretend that whoever is reading this never saw your pitch.

You'll also want to link your pitch at the top of your story - you can do that by typing a # and then your pitch's issue number. You can find the issue number in the URL. The sample one is at `https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/1`, so the link can be made by typing #1. It will automatically link to your pitch.

## Step 5: Posting updates

As you work on your story, add updates! Little image previews or links to your forked repository would be great. [Here is an example of an update](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/2#issuecomment-234383998).

## Step 6: More peer feedback

Now that you've been approved, the feedback should be a little more particular. "This particular color is hard to read" or "you might want to look at how you're treating that categorical variable." While you don't have to do what other people say, it's definitely good to think about.

[Here is some feedback from the sample story issue](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/2#issuecomment-234384424).

## Step 7: Requesting approval

Once you're done, send a pull request with your new content. **Make sure you include your story's issue number, like #2**. Someone might also label that your story issue needs editorial approval.

[Pretend I sent a pull request here](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/2#issuecomment-234384971), which then gets approved and the story issue is finally closed.
