# Title: Exploring the PERM data set

## Summary:
Have the chances of various nations to get PERM work permits in the United states
changed?

## Data Source:
[PERM data 2009 - 2016](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/docs/Performance_Data/Disclosure)
[Natural Earth Data](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/110m-admin-0-countries/)

## Regression:
Regular linear regression and develop a prediction model

## Goals:
- Scatter plot with regression line, commenting on the extremes for most
interesting years.
- Use the predictor so users can input a nation from a list, and, based on
the past years, get a reply what  
- Do the same with specific jobs. I may, however, need to include the other
PERM data for this.
