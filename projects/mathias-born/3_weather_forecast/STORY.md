title: Do forecasters weather the storm?
summary: Most people rely on it -- even if they would't call this information reliable: How good or bad is the weather forecast in reality? I will scrape some information of the five days forecast from major forecast providers in Switzerland and compare it to the measurements five days later.

The main part of this project is to program the scrapers.
