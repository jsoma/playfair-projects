title: Do forecasters weather the storm?
summary: Most people rely on it -- even if they would't call this information reliable: How good or bad is the weather forecast in reality? I will scrape some information of the five days forecast from major forecast providers in Switzerland and compare it to the measurements five days later.

Possible headlines:

- No clouds on the sky: The forecasters are doing an excellent job
- Don't rely on the forecasters
- Why one forecaster expects rain and the other sun


The main part of this project is to program the scrapers.
