# Tourists in Bern

"Swiss Statistics", the federal office for statistics in Switzerland, publishes data about the number of nights tourists stay in the country. 

The data is available [to download] in various formats. I selected the dataset containing the nights and the country of origin of the tourists in the canton of Bern -- the region that my news organization covers.

Most important finding: While the number of nights for all tourists was slightly increasing and is now more or less stable, the number of nights that the best foreign guests spend in Bern declines.
