# Diary

- I was using this dataset for an earlier assignment. I did have a hard time then because the data was not structured in a way that I could use.
- In the second attempt, I didn't have many of the previous problems anymore. One of the main reasons is that we learned to use timeseries in Pandas. 
- I was struggling with the plot function, though. For example, I had to figure out how to add a second axes. 
- The TAs and I didn't manage it to add two different kinds of graphs on one plot. And the adjustment of the two graphs was difficult. Finally, I decided to take the two plots out seperately and combine it in Inkscape.
