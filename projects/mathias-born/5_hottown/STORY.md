title: "Hot town -- Summer in New York City"
summary: It's getting hot in New York City. And it's getting quite cold inside. I am trying to mesure the temperature, humidity and noise in this project.

I used an Arduino for mesuring the temperature, humidity and noise. You will find the sketch in the directory tourilogger_wlan. The result is an interactive map: [tourimap.html](tourimap.html). 

There are some exports here:
