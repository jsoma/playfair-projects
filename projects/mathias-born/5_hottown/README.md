# Hot Town -- Summer in New York City

This is a project I am working on at Columbia University's Lede 12 program. 

- The product of this project is the slippy map [tourimap.html](tourimap.html).
- The Arduino sketch is in the folder Arduino_WLAN.
- You will find a longish documentation of the process is in DIARY.md.
