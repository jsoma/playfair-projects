# Keep it Rolling -- Where did all these players go?

This is a project I have been working on at Columbia University's Lede 12 program in summer 2016. 

- The data was gathered by the sports department of my newspaper. They will also be in charge of updating the data. Since the work on the data is not finished yet, I will only publish excerpts here. 
- Product of the projects are some visualizations. I will also work on other ways of presenting the data in future.
