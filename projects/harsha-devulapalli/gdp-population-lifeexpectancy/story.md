Originally, I had intended to produce a small multiples map of the GDP, Populations and Life Expectancy of all countries in the world. The idea was to see if a small multiples would be useful in determining how countries fare with each other. If the axes weren't constant, each one of them has the potential to explain a country's "growth" or "decline". But with constant axes, it is evident to see two kinds of categories that countries are clumped into : One with really high GDPs and nearly filling up the figure and another with mostly really thin lines.

I believe, that while as a story it would be not be too useful - i think, my code has to be tweaked just a little bit to produce these for every country in the world as images that can be uploaded to Wikipedia Commons. I believe, it can serve some purpose in illustrating a particular index.

**Populations of Countries of the World**

If kept to scale, apart from the countries of China, India, Brazil, US and Indonesia, most countries would look like flat lines. Hence I chose to retain them to their own scales, instead of keeping a common one.
For most countries since the 1950s, the growth has been linear - is that a measure of peace? Or is it the growth before the fall?

**Life Expectancy**

This is something I've kept to scale because no country has yet managed to find ways of getting most humans to live beyond 100. It shows you that almost all countries in the world have managed to make significant progress when it comes to life expectancy figures. The only dips in the figure happen when there is large scale conflicts such as war or genocide. Refer to Rwanda in the late 80s, China in the 60s, and Syria currently.
