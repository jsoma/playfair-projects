## No Cold War, No Space Race ! ##

This is the readme file for the story 'No Cold War, No Space Race'.

### Data Source ###

The NASA Laboratory facilities data set is from Data.gov: http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/agency-data-on-user-facilities.
The Federal funding data set is from the Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA. 


In the past, I had analyzed the data using pandas and created basic graphs. This time, in addition to reworking on the graphs that I had created earlier, more graphs have been added to visually represent the distribution and growth trend of NASA Laboratory facilities in the USA. What I have discovered is astounding. The number of new facilities has been drastically reduced from 60s to now. In 60s, around 152 new labs have been started operating, whereas in 2010-2016 the number has come down to just a few.
