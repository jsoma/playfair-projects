## Challenges I Faced While Working on the Story ##

* Finding the reliable dataset
* Color combination for the graphics
* Playing with selection tool on the Illustrator
* Illustrator options
* Scraping the data from Wikipedia (yet to talk to TA why I failed in scraping the data)
* Developing  an interesting story around the data. (Thanks to my peer reviewers and editor for the help)
