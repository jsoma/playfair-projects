## No Cold War, No Space Race ! Dramatic Reduction in the Number of New NASA Research Facilities in the US ##

The world despised the cold war era. But let's look at the brighter side. One is the presence of two balancing polarities of power distribution. The other, no doubt, is the space race. Launch of Sputnik spawned a new era of competition in spaceflight capabilities, which went on to initiate lunar missions by both the parties. The US found success whereas USSR floundered despite the repeated attempts. The rivalry for supremacy intensified, so the need for space research facilities.

Growing up in the cold war era, closely watching the USSR and US competing for the number 1 position in the space race, I have always been curious about the expansion of NASA. For the same reasons, I poked around a bit on Internet for all the available sources, but finally decided to zero on the one from Data.Gov. To dig deeper, it's essential to see the picture on the Federal funding side. I went ahead and grabbed the data on Federal funding for NASA from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA.  What's astounding is that there is a steady decline in the percent of Federal budget allotted to NASA. So I concluded that cold war is the one major factor in the development of new space research facilities in the USA. With the collapse of USSR, along with arm race, space race also reached a dead end.


### An Insight Into NASA Laboratory Facilities ###

* NASA runs a total of 397 lab facilities, Nasa Intelsat runs 17, Department of Defence(DOD) runs 7 labs, Department of Energy runs 12 labs, Raytheon runs 5, and Orbital Sciences Corporation (osc) runs only one NASA lab facility.
* The highest number of labs are located in the state : Alabama
* The lowest number of labs are located in the state : Arizona
* The highest number of labs started during the period: 1960 - 69
* The number of facilities started during this period is : 152
* The agency that has the highest number of labs: NASA 2 (I guess it stands for NASA Glenn Research Facilities. I will confirm)
* During 2010- 2016 only two new lab facilities has been started. They are DYNAVAC THERMAL VACUUM CHAMBER and General Vibration Lab (GVL).
* Roslin HIcks handles the highest number of facilities. Under him there are 136 labs.
* Marshall Space Flight Center has the highest number of lab facilities. The number is again 136.
* There are 388 active NASA lab facilities in the US.
* There are 22 inactive lab facilities in the US.
